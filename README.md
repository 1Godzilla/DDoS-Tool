Here’s a README.md file for a Python-based DDoS tool. This README includes an introduction, setup instructions, usage details, and a disclaimer emphasizing ethical considerations.

Python DDoS Tool

A Python-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) tool for educational purposes. This tool simulates DDoS attack methods to demonstrate the impact of network-based attacks and help security professionals understand and test the robustness of network defenses.

Disclaimer: This tool is intended for educational and ethical penetration testing only. Unauthorized use against any system is illegal and unethical. Please obtain permission if you are testing this tool on any system not owned by you.

Features

	•	Customizable Target: Allows users to specify the target IP address or URL.
	•	Adjustable Parameters: Supports configuration of packet size, number of packets, and duration.
	•	Simulated Attack Modes: Implements common DDoS techniques, such as SYN flood and UDP flood.
	•	Logs: Records the results of each run for analysis and educational insights.

Requirements

	•	Python 3.x
	•	Socket Library: (usually included with Python)

Setup

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-ddos-tool.git


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd python-ddos-tool


	3.	Run the script:

python ddos_tool.py



Usage

	1.	Run the DDoS Tool:
	•	You’ll be prompted to enter the target IP address, port, packet size, and duration of the attack.
	•	The tool will then attempt to overload the target’s resources.
	2.	Example:

Target IP: 192.168.1.10
Target Port: 80
Packet Size: 1024
Duration (seconds): 30

Output:

Sending packets to 192.168.1.10 on port 80...
Attack in progress for 30 seconds.
DDoS simulation completed.



Attack Modes

	•	SYN Flood: Sends a flood of SYN packets to the target’s open port, attempting to exhaust server resources.
	•	UDP Flood: Sends a flood of UDP packets, creating a high volume of traffic aimed at overwhelming the target.

Important Notes

	•	Ethical Usage: This tool should only be used in environments where you have explicit permission, such as a personal test server.
	•	Network Impact: Running this tool can consume significant bandwidth and affect network stability. Use responsibly.

Project Structure

	•	ddos_tool.py: Main script containing DDoS functions and user prompts.
	•	logs/: Directory to store logs of each run (optional).
